# N-Queens Problem

This project implements and benchmarks multiple algorithms for solving the classic N-Queens problem, which asks for a placement of N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

## Features

- Multiple solver implementations:
  - DFS Exhaustive Solver
  - Genetic Algorithm Solver
  - Optimized Genetic Solver
  - Hill Climbing Solver
  - Optimized Hill Climbing Solver
  - (Optionally) Simulated Annealing Solver
- Benchmarking framework for time, memory, and correctness
- Visualization of results

## Solvers

- **DFS Exhaustive Solver**: Classic backtracking approach, guarantees a solution if one exists, but is slow for large N.
- **Genetic Algorithm Solver**: Uses evolutionary strategies to search for solutions, faster but may not always find a solution.
- **Optimized Genetic Solver**: Enhanced genetic algorithm with adaptive mutation and population restart.
- **Hill Climbing Solver**: Greedy local search, may get stuck in local minima.
- **Optimized Hill Climbing Solver**: Uses min-conflicts heuristic and multiple restarts for better performance.
- **Simulated Annealing Solver**: (Optional) Probabilistic local search with temperature-based escape from local minima.

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    poetry install
    ```

2. **Run benchmarks**:
    #### Go to this file and see what it runs, it also have RUN_IN_MULTITHREAD if set to True runs solvers in parallel
    ```bash
    python src/banchmark.py
    ```

3. **View results**:
    - Plots and markdown tables are generated in the `src/plots/` directory.
    - Aggregated results are in `src/plots/aggregate_results.md`.

## Benchmark Results

Below are the aggregated benchmark results for all solvers:
